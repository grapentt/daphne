 * @brief Rewrites the trace idiom `sum(diag(X @ Y))` to `sum(X * t(Y))`.
 *
 * DAPHNE has no trace op, so the trace of a matrix product is spelled
 * `sum(diagVector(X @ Y))`. Using the identity
 *
 *     trace(X @ Y) = sum_i (X @ Y)[i, i]
 *                  = sum_i sum_j X[i, j] * Y[j, i]
 *                  = sum(X (elementwise*) t(Y)),
 *
 * this replaces an O(n^2 * m) matrix product, whose off-diagonal entries the
 * diagVector immediately discards, with an O(n * m) element-wise product.
 *
 * The rewrite fails closed, matching only a non-transposed product of operands
 * that share an element type and whose result is statically known to be square;
 * see the per-guard comments below for why each is needed.

/**
 * @brief Regroups `(M1 + s1) + (M2 + s2)` to `(M1 + M2) + (s1 + s2)`.
 *
 * When two matrix-plus-scalar broadcasts are added, the scalars can be summed
 * once up front instead of broadcast across every element twice. The rewrite
 * pulls the two matrix operands into one matrix add and the two scalars into one
 * scalar add, turning two element-wise scalar broadcasts into one.
 *
 * Integer-only. Over IEEE floating point addition is not associative: each `+`
 * rounds, and regrouping four distinct addends changes which intermediate is
 * rounded first, so the rewrite would not be value-preserving. Over integers it
 * is exact in Z/2^n (the scalar sum may overflow, but the wrapped value is the
 * correct ring element, so it is never a bail condition).
 *
 * All four element types are pinned to one integer type. `hasScaType` alone would
 * admit float, string, index, and boolean scalars, so soundness rests on the
 * explicit `IntegerType` check plus the element-type-equality guards, not on
 * `hasScaType`. Pinning the operand types also stops EwAdd's CastArgsToResType
 * from promoting the two new adds to a wider accumulation type.
 *
 * Terminating: the output is `ewAdd(M1 + M2, s1 + s2)` whose operands are a
 * matrix-plus-matrix and a scalar-plus-scalar, neither of which classifies as a
 * matrix-plus-scalar broadcast, so the pattern cannot match its own result.
